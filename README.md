## Marlin 1.1

Marlin 1.1 represents an evolutionary leap over Marlin 1.0.2. It is the result of over two years of effort by several volunteers around the world who have paid meticulous and sometimes obsessive attention to every detail. For this release we focused on code quality, performance, stability, and overall user experience. Several new features have also been added, many of which require no extra hardware.

## Stable Release Branch

This Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.1.2 – May 2017).

## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

## Contributing to Marlin

This branch is used to accumulate patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Recent Changes
- Add a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) supporting current AVR platforms
- Planning a HAL for Re:Arm
- Planning a HAL for STM32

## Current Status: In Development

Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against this branch ([bugfix-2.0.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x)).

- This branch is for fixing bugs and integrating any new features for the duration of the Marlin 2.0.x life-cycle.
- Follow the [Coding Standards](http://marlinfw.org/docs/development/coding_standards.html) to gain points with the maintainers.
- Please submit your questions and concerns to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues).

Marlin 1.1 is the last "flat" version of Marlin!

Arduino IDE now has support for folder hierarchies, so Marlin 1.2 will have a [hierarchical file structure](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/breakup-marlin-idea). Marlin's newly reorganized code will be easier to work with and form a stronger starting-point as we get into [32-bit CPU support](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/32-Bit-RCBugFix-new) and the Hardware Access Layer (HAL).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](https://github.com/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
